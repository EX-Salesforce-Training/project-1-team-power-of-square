Big Business Postal Service

We make deals with large companies to mass ship product or
ship and send packages for people within the company.

Mass Shipments go to a specific address and we sell subscriptions
to companies for 1,000,000 a month. If a company is thinking about purchasing
a subscription to our service can be counted as an opportunity.

If a company gets out subscription they have access to a certain amount of 
mass shipments per month along with accounts for individuals within the company
to join our community to get updates with our business. Those individuals can request
drone shipping for personal smaller items.

We also offer insurance on sending mail, with our subscription you get the basic
insurance. With spending more money your company can get our platinum insurance
that gives a much larger payout.

For our drones there are 2 models. Our Sonic Drones are smaller faster drones that can carry a couple
packages at a time to a specific location. Our other model is our Big Drone which carries up to
20 packages in separate compartments that goes on specific routes around town.

Drones aren't perfect. We haven't found the technology to safely place packages on the ground.
So we offer different padding for our packages ranging from bubble wrap to memory foam to make
those package drops much safer.
