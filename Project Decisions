Roles for p1
Community Leader: Sal
Salesforce Admin: Dani
Project Manager: Jon
Flex Player: Josh

Big Business Postal Service

We make deals with large companies to mass ship product or
ship and send packages for people within the company.

Mass Shipments go to a specific address and we sell subscriptions
to companies for 1,000,000 a month. If a company is thinking about purchasing
a subscription to our service can be counted as an opportunity.

If a company gets out subscription they have access to a certain amount of 
mass shipments per month along with accounts for individuals within the company
to join our community to get updates with our business. Those individuals can request
drone shipping for personal smaller items.

We also offer insurance on sending mail, with our subscription you get the basic
insurance. With spending more money your company can get our platinum insurance
that gives a much larger payout.

For our drones there are 2 models. Our Sonic Drones are smaller faster drones that can carry a couple
packages at a time to a specific location. Our other model is our Big Drone which carries up to
20 packages in separate compartments that goes on specific routes around town.

Drones aren't perfect. We haven't found the technology to safely place packages on the ground.
So we offer different padding for our packages ranging from bubble wrap to memory foam to make
those package drops much safer.

Data Model: 

Accounts Object - Our Business Partners
Contacts Object - Individuals within our business partners
Drones Custom Object- Two record types for Sonic Drones and Big Drones
Package Custom Object- Needs Delivery Status, Tracking Number, Customer and Account relationship, Recipient Info
Products - Package wrapper, Pens, packaging
Services - Shipping type, insurance type
Leads - Businesses interested in our subscription
Opportunities - Businesses in the process of deciding to get our subscription
Cases - still need to decide how to implement

Security and Access:

Employees - Customer Support, Sales, Drone Expert, Mass Shipment Driver
End Users - Full Business Profiles, Individual Conact Profiles

Process Automation Implementation:

Approval Process: Insurance Payouts, Discount for Pricebook
Workflows: New Outbound Message for package is near-by, email internal users when an opportunity is closed
Flows: Guide end users in registering mail with-in our system, Guide end users to create community account
Process Builder: Updates delivery status to missing and creates a case if mail is past due.

"Analysis and Design"
07/31/2020

We talked about what we want our community to feel like and see our options.
We want to have our big business clients to have a page for their whole company and each employee
can have their own account thats connected to only that business and only see applicable data.
We also want the ability to share updates with our own business and share opportunities to all
accounts. We also want to have knowledge topics to answer frequently asked questions and allow
comments so people in the community can help each other.

We also want our visualforce page to include components to show the required information from the
core requirements in the project guidelines. We also want to let end users create mail records
through our community, we just have to see if we can implement a flow to our community page or if we
should customize a wizard for the option.

Started our first sprint with a 45 min meeting to delegate tasks and plan the rest
of the sprint. Sprints will be in 3 days period.

"Interval Review and Retrospective"
08/02/2020

For the interval review Danielle showed everyone the custom objects she created in her SalesForce
Org and the Schema she generated. Jonathan showed everyone the products and different pricebooks that
he created. Sal showed everyone the Community that was initilized and talked about the research he
has done for the project. Joshua talked about his research and plans to implement VisualForce 
components into the community.

For the end of interval retrospective we talked about what went well, researching and
planning seemed to go fine however, the thing that we need to work on for the next interval
is time management because it was stressful at first juggling all of our work. We decided
a course of action is to increase communication and help wherever needed.

"Start of Sprint Meeting"
08/03/2020

We started this meeting off talking about how we want the end presentation to look.
That way we can better decide on how we want to continue our work. We talked about the next 
few intervals and what we can accomplish in each one. Since the first interval was mainly planning
and prep work this second interval will be all about completing solo work. That solo work includes:

Danielle: ServiceCloud implementation
Jonathan: SalesCloud implementation and Process Automation
Joshua: VisualForce Components and Apex Controllers
Sal: Lightning Knowldege Articles and branching topics

We decided our community is going to be used to inform our end users of business events
and also FAQ. We will allow our customers to comment on specific threads to provide help others
in the community who are struggling with a specifc business processes. We're also going to
create mock data to perform tests on in each org. That mock data will consist of fake businesses,
employees of those businesses, packages for those businesses, and internal users of the org.
