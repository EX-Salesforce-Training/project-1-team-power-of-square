Big Business Postal Service

We make deals with large companies to mass ship product or
ship and send packages for people within the company.

Mass Shipments go to a specific address and we sell subscriptions
to companies for 1,000,000 a month. If a company is thinking about purchasing
a subscription to our service can be counted as an opportunity.

If a company gets out subscription they have access to a certain amount of 
mass shipments per month along with accounts for individuals within the company
to join our community to get updates with our business. Those individuals can request
drone shipping for personal smaller items.

We also offer insurance on sending mail, with our subscription you get the basic
insurance. With spending more money your company can get our platinum insurance
that gives a much larger payout.

For our drones there are 2 models. Our Sonic Drones are smaller faster drones that can carry a couple
packages at a time to a specific location. Our other model is our Big Drone which carries up to
20 packages in separate compartments that goes on specific routes around town.

Drones aren't perfect. We haven't found the technology to safely place packages on the ground.
So we offer different padding for our packages ranging from bubble wrap to memory foam to make
those package drops much safer.

Data Model: 

Accounts Object - Our Business Partners
Contacts Object - Individuals within our business partners
Drones Custom Object- Two record types for Sonic Drones and Big Drones
Package Custom Object- Needs Delivery Status, Tracking Number, Customer and Account relationship, Recipient Info

"Analysis and Design"
07/31/2020

We talked about what we want our community to feel like and see our options.
We want to have our big business clients to have a page for their whole company and each employee
can have their own account thats connected to only that business and only see applicable data.
We also want the ability to share updates with our own business and share opportunities to all
accounts. We also want to have knowledge topics to answer frequently asked questions and allow
comments so people in the community can help each other.

We also want our visualforce page to include components to show the required information from the
core requirements in the project guidelines. We also want to let end users create mail records
through our community, we just have to see if we can implement a flow to our community page or if we
should customize a wizard for the option.
